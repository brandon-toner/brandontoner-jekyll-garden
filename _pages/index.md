# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
 Welcome to the (very new) garden.
</p>

## What is this?

This is a digital garden. A hypertext blog. A place for an evolving network of ideas.

But more importantly, this is a playground. A sandbox. A place for me to explore concepts of web design & programming â€”Â to [learn in context]([[learning in context]])

I'll likely build this up, tear it down, leave it idle for a while â€” then come back, pick it up again, and carry on.

It's also a place where I can publish public links and post writing online. 

Perhaps I'll start writing more, who knows. After all, I seem to have most of the infrastructure setup now!

## What tools am I using?

### .md Editor

I'm using iA Writer for .md editing, though probably going to use something else, like Obsidian/Bear, that has wiki-links built in.

I'd like to be able to create new pages inline by just adding [[]] and *boom*, new page added to the directory.

> and *boom*, new page added to the directory

Hmmm... Maybe not new right away, but when I click on it, it creates a new page. Like in Bear.

Bottomline: The program should have an awareness of what other .md files are in the directory, and present them in a sidebar.

### File Manager

Files for this site are stored locally on my folder in a site folder setup by the template. The files are synced with my GitHub account, and then sent to Notify.

Whenever I make changes to the files in the folder, I commit and push the changes in Terminal using the git protocol. 

Then it's live. Kinda magical.

Super easy.

### Code Editor

Using VS Code to edit HTML files, with an extension that gives me a "Live Preview" of the code.

## About this template

This digital garden template is free and open-source. There's a nice demo page and tutorial [here](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). Developed by Maxime Vaillancourt.
