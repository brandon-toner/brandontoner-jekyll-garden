## What are paragraph links?

Most pages on the web have a hyperlink that can take you to the **page**. Paragraph links send a link to the page, but also contain directions to scroll to the **position on the page**. 

Using paragraph links allows you to make very specific references â€” pointing out a particular section or passage.
