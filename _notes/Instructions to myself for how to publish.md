I'm doing this because I just opened this folder for the first time in several months and felt like I forgot *everything* about using Terminal and publishing. It's easy, but also easy to forget if you fall out of practice. A good reminder on the importance of keeping documentation and a learning log.
- Open vault in *Obsidian*.
- Create new note within "notes" folder, or edit existing notes.
- Open *Terminal*
- Navigate to the right spot with "cd websites/my-digital-garden/" (or something like that... it autopopulates)
- Once there, it ?FISH (terminal skin) should display git status 
- Enter "git status"
- Enter "git add" (then tab to autocomplete) 
- Enter "git commit" (then tab to autocomplete)
- Enter "git push" (then tab to autocomplete)
- The green git symbol by itself indicates that the repository is in alignment with the local folder. (Everything has been published successfully)
