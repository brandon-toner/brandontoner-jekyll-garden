This is a digital garden. A hypertext blog. A place for an evolving network of ideas.

But more importantly, this is a playground. A sandbox. A place for me to explore concepts of web design & programming — to [[learning in context|learn in context]]

I'll likely build this up, tear it down, leave it idle for a while — then come back, pick it up again, and carry on.

It's also a place where I can publish public links and post writing online. 

Perhaps I'll start writing more, who knows. After all, I seem to have most of the infrastructure setup now!

## What tools am I using?

### .md Editor

~~I'm using iA Writer for .md editing, though probably going to use something else, like Obsidian/Bear, that has wiki-links built in.~~

Yea, I switched to Obsidian. Way better.

### File Manager

Files for this site are stored locally on my folder in a site folder setup by the template. The files are synced with my GitHub account, and then sent to Notify.

Whenever I make changes to the files in the folder, I commit and push the changes in Terminal using the git protocol. 

Then it's live. Kinda magical.

Super easy.

### Code Editor

Using VS Code to edit HTML and other code files, with an extension that gives me a "Live Preview" of the code.

## [[Open Questions]]

- ~~Can I bury page links in aliases? (Didn't work further up this page)~~ (resolved)
- Can I wrap content in an inline code block to change the rendering? (Didn't work when I tried to wrap the wiki-links further up the page)

## Other Comments

- I miss block references a bit. Saying "further up the page" without being able to point to it is weird haha.
- I'll make this all much more atomic sometime, I'm just clearing my head here now.

## Wild & Wacky Wish-list

- Paragraph links
- Visitor comments
- Email gathering for list / other form stuff
