This is a digital garden. A hypertext blog. A place for an evolving network of ideas.

But more importantly, this is a playground. A sandbox. A place for me to explore concepts of web design & programming — to [[Learning in context|learn in context]]

I'll likely build this up, tear it down, leave it idle for a while — then come back, pick it up again, and carry on.

It's also a place where I can publish public links and post writing online. 

Perhaps I'll start writing more, who knows. After all, I seem to have most of the infrastructure setup now!
