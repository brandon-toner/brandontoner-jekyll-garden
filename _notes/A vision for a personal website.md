*I want* a space where I can explore ideas. To be able to link them together, developing my ideas over time. 
*I want* this to be a public space — one where I can think in public, and share ideas with others. Yet, I also want to restrict access to some areas (e.g. business documents)
*I want* this to be a place where visitors can comment and contribute. To engage — give feedback, add their thoughts as they arise. 
*I want* to have parts that are messy and exploratory — and others that are more polished and complete. I want it to feel welcoming to whatever thoughts I have —  raw or refined. After all, the raw is what leads to the refined.
*I want* to write about different subjects and interests — rather than limiting to a specific topic/genre. Yet, I want to create cohesive experience — one where if someone visits in relation to a certain area (e.g. pharmacy), they see mainly ideas related to that area.

### How might this look?
I imagine three core components:
- About page
- Blog
- Wiki/Garden

#### About page
A general landing page. 
About me, at a glance. 
This is the "Who What When Where Why" stuff.
I also like the idea of having a "Next, Now and Lately" page here to capture where my focus/attention is at any given time.

#### The blog
Using the ["Garden and the Stream"](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) metaphor from Michael Caulfield, the blog is the **stream**. 
It's the reverse-chronological feed of new posts and updates. The stuff as it happens. The cutting edge. The ephemeral and fleeting.

#### The wiki
Continuing the methaphor, the wiki is the **garden**. The "web as topography". The stable and evolving landscape of ideas. Rather than being centered around "now and lately", the garden is time-independant. Instead, it centers around the ideas themselves and how they fit together.
