### Bugs
- Aliases intermittently not working on the site, despite working in Obsidian. 
	- I thiiiiink the syntax is right. I recall having one that worked.

### Frustrations
- Inability to reference a paragraph.
- No auto-index or search for the site (likely could add, or choose another template)
	- I'm also not sure whether I *want* these features...
- Difficulty in reordering outlines in Obsidian/markdown (because it's not an outliner)
- Inability to collapse headings (like in an outline)
- No TOC option (this is likely something I can do within Obsidian, hopefully rendering properly on the site)
- The graph at the bottom of each page show *all* notes in the graph... 
	- I think I'd prefer JUST the connections to the current note.
