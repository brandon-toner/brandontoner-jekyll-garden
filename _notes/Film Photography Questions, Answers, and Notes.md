# Gear
- I inherited a [1952 Futura S](https://mikeeckman.com/2020/02/futura-s-1952/) from my Grandfather
- Looking to purchase:
	1. a mechanical SLR (likely a Nikon F2)
	2. a more lightweight and portable option to take hiking
	3. a "beater"

# Questions (& Answers, sometimes)
## Gear
- **What lenses should I buy for the Nikon F2?**
	- 50mm 1.8 sounds great
	- Maybe a 35mm and something more telephoto.
- **What should I aim to get as a lightweight hiking option?**
- **What should I aim to get as a beater?**

## Film
- **What film should I use primarily? (A color & B&W option)**
	- I have some Kodak Plus 200 and 400XT (B&W)
	- A friend suggested:
		- Porta 160 and Porta 400 (nice, soft, strong colours — even better overexposed 1-2 stops)
		- pro-image 100 (a cheaper budget option)
		- Fuji Superia 400 (a bit green, rough looking, but endearing)
		- HP5 asd a B&W option (shoot it at 1600, vs 400, and push 2 stops in development — contrasty look, works well in low light and concerts)
		- TMax (more subtle and less contrasty than TX)
- **Where should I buy film?**
	- Leaning towards [Downtown Camera](https://downtowncamera.com/) (same place I'm looking to develop)
- **What quality scanning should I select from Downtown Camera?**
	- jpeg is likely fine for most purposes. Definitely to start. ($7.50 per roll)
	- TIFF is $15 per roll 
- **What is the process for developing film at DTC?**
	- Extract film from camera
	- Use online portal to place order
	- Drop off in Halifax (free), or mail from CB
	- Wait for invoice, scans, and mailed negatives.
- **What is the approximate cost per roll of fill processed?**
	- VERY rough estimate
		- $10 per roll, likely
		- $15 ish for processing.
		- + shipping. 
		- Total = ~$30/roll  
	- Save money by:
		- Film in bulk
		- Using Halifax Film Collective Perks
			- Free mail-out
			- Discount on film
		- Develop only, then scan myself using Digital camera.
			- This sounds a bit complicated... later.
		- Wait until I have several rolls to save on shipping costs.
	- Call it ~$1/photo
- **What is the processing time at DTC?**
	- About a week from when they get the film.
- **How should I store film?**
	- Undeveloped vs Developed: Is there a storage difference?
	- How important is proper storage?
	- Some people keep it in the freezer, is this a good idea?
- **How long does film last before expiry?**
	- Is expired film still usable?
- **How do I scan or print from negatives?**
