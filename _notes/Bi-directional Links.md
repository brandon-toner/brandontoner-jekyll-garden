## What are bi-directional links?
Most links on the internet are one-directional. Bi-directional links (or wiki-links) allow travel in both directions. 

When bi-directional links are used, it is possible to see what pages link to the page you are currently viewing (places where the current page is mentioned). On this template, they appear in the sidebar under **"Notes mentioning this note"**.
