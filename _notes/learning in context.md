Whenever I am trying to learn something new, I try to apply it as soon as I can.

Things seem to stick better when I have something real and tangible that I am applying the knowledge to.

That context also gives me a *reason* to learn. The learning becomes a means to solve problems or accomplish specific tasks â€” rather than layering abstractions in a theoretical framework in your head.

The *experience* of just-in-time learning, applied to a meaningful context gives you lots of hooks to remember and integrate the knowledge.
