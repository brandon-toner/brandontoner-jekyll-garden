### .md Editor

~~I'm using iA Writer for .md editing, though probably going to use something else, like Obsidian/Bear, that has wiki-links built in.~~

Yea, I switched to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Way better.

### File Manager

Files for this site are stored locally on my folder in a site folder setup by the template. The files are synced with my GitHub account, and then sent to Netify.

Whenever I make changes to the files in the folder, [[Instructions to myself for how to publish|I commit and push the changes in Terminal using the git protocol]].

Then it's live. Kinda magical.

Super easy.

### Code Editor

Using VS Code to edit HTML and other code files, with an extension that gives me a "Live Preview" of the code.
