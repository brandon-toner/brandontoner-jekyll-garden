**Idea:** The ability to collapse sections of an article or a blog post based on markdown heading status.

When reading any sort of material â€” I like to maintain a sense of *where I am* in the context of the full text. Within an outliner, I do this by collapsing the surrounding sections. 

What I'd like to be able to do on a site like this, is to support the ability to collapse sections based on the heading tags (h1, h2, h3, h4)

Is this possible outside of an outline format? Maybe with the use of javascript? Do others want this sort of things? 

Collapsing sections helps to manipulate perspective and context. It focuses the experience.

Other ideas and solutions:
- Breadcrumbs 
- Tables of contents
- Pinch to zoom out (get the "bird's eye view")
