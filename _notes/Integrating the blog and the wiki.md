Blog = Stream; Wiki = Garden

When I first heard of digital gardens, I thought of them as an *enhancement* to blogs. An alternate form of expression focused on forming a network of ideas, as opposed to a feed of content.

Lately, I've been thinking of the two formats as companions. [[The stream hydrates the garden.]]

## Ideas for integrating the blog and the garden
- [[Auto-posting updates to the garden to the blog]]
- Blog as loose, free expression -> Distilled into more polished garden entries.

## Barriers and problems
I can already sense a bit of *tension* on where to write. The system of integration feels good in theory — but in reality I have a bit of a [["Do it live!"]] style. No need for a delineation between messy and polished. 

Most "polish" I write, if I ever get to that stage, is just stream-of-consciousness anyway. I'm not much of a planner/editor.

Based on this, I'm likely to just write directly into the garden. Though I like the idea of a blog! 

### What do I like about a blog?
- It's focused on "now"
- It can be the basis of distribution / RSS

### Blog as changelog 
As in [[Auto-posting updates to the garden to the blog]], I like the idea of the blog being a feed of edits to the garden — with maybe a bit of added flair to keep it readable and entertaining. 

Edits + commentary + new posts debut there? Is that too much work?
